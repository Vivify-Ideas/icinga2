# Ansible monitoring Icinga

You can use this repo to create a Vagrant Debian box and provision it using Ansible playbooks to create an Icinga 2 monitoring sattelite.

Ansible will install LAMP stack in the machine as well as Icinga 2 packages and Nagios plugins.

You currently need to manually add Icinga 2 master and connect to it.
Soon, this will be automated.
